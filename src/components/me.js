                Welcome to my development portfolio!  I have always enjoyed finding creative ways to 
                solve problems and working in IT provided a platform where I can do just that!
                I started my career out as a developer, or programmer as it was known as back then, and have had 
                a satisfying career spanning a number of roles; systems analyst, team leader, solution designer, 
                manager where I was managing teams of software engineers and technical business analysts. I have 
                gained a lot of knowledge by being part of a myriad of exciting projects; conversions, 
                integrations, B2B solutions, B2C consumer spanning mainframe to client-server applications
                </p>
                <p>     
                Throughout the course of my career I have never stopped learning and if I don't know something 
                I will try and get my head around it until I feel comfortable and confident with whatever 
                chellenge comes my way.  I believe I can make a positive contribution with this 
                experience and the knowledge that I have gained. 
                </p>
